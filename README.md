A munin plugin to monitor the Freebox v6
========================================

I wrote this quick and dirty plugin for munin to demonstrate a hardware failure to my ISP.

With this, you will be able to monitor the temperatures,  the fan, the line SNR, ... of the freebox v6.

Hope this can be of any help.

See this inside doc for details and usage.
